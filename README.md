# JewelAR
An AR-app that uses basic mobile vision to calculate points of neck and ears based on these points, anchors jewellery images to those point.

- uses mobile vision
- approximates coordinates of neck and ears
- supports scaling of overlays with change in user's distance from camera
- somewhat works with lateral movement too
